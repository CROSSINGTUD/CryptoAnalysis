Rap was rarely good to me, rap always punched me in the face
Too often I hid away in my room with pen and paper
I've never free styled, I've never dared to
I'd rather been MC, but I was just a woman
It took years til i became aware of myself
Til I had a base and fame but then came the fear of loss
Coz who would give up what she has fought for
especially if you for once have found trust in yourself
my role annoys the crap out of me, it always has
Of course, I'da prefered to be famous for MC-ing
Dominance needs resistance and I am a high achiever
Those who swim against the current face heavy opposition
I've made a name for myself as a queerfeminist MC
This is my seventh release, I've always loved rap
I was always pumped and always celebrated it, but I hated it even more
